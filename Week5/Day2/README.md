### Key Learning Topics

#### 1. Shift-Left Security
- **Expanded Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Shift-Left Security moves security checks to the earliest stages of the SDLC—coding, building, and testing—using Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to analyze source code for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
  - **Context**: Rooted in DevOps’ “fail fast” ethos, it’s a DevSecOps pillar (DevOps Handbook) that reduces remediation costs by 10-100x compared to post-deploy fixes (IBM System Sciences Institute). It’s proactive, not reactive.
  - **Importance**: Critical for CI/CD speed (e.g., daily releases at Amazon) and compliance (e.g., OWASP Top 10 mitigation), preventing flaws from reaching millions of users.
  - **Tools**: 
    - Checkmarx: Enterprise-grade SAST for languages like Java, Python.
    - SonarQube: Open-source SAST with CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions).
    - GitHub CodeQL: Semantic code analysis for vulnerability detection.
  - **Metrics**: False positive rate, vulnerability severity (e.g., CVSS scores), scan time.
- **Additional Insight**: Integrates with IDEs (e.g., VS Code plugins) for real-time feedback, a Fortune 100 practice (e.g., Microsoft’s dev workflow).

#### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- **Expanded Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: DAST scans running applications for runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, broken authentication) by simulating attacks, complementing SAST’s static scope.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps runtime safety net (OWASP guidance), often run in staging or pre-prod to catch environment-specific issues (e.g., misconfigured headers).
  - **Importance**: Identifies exploitable flaws missed in code (e.g., 2020 Zoom DAST-found vuln), essential for customer-facing apps (e.g., PCI DSS 6.6) and scales to millions of requests.
  - **Tools**: 
    - OWASP ZAP: Open-source DAST with automated scanning and reporting.
    - Burp Suite: Professional-grade for manual and automated testing.
    - AWS Inspector: Cloud-native DAST for EC2-hosted apps.
  - **Metrics**: Scan coverage, exploit success rate, time to detect.
- **Additional Insight**: Often paired with penetration testing for Fortune 100 audits (e.g., Microsoft’s Azure security).

#### 3. Policy as Code
- **Expanded Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Policy as Code uses programmable rules (e.g., Open Policy Agent - OPA) to enforce security and compliance (e.g., no privileged pods, restricted ingress) in Kubernetes, IaC, or pipelines.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps evolution from manual checklists to automated governance (e.g., CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks), enabling consistency across 1000s of resources.
  - **Importance**: Scales security for microservices (e.g., 2021 Kaseya breach prevention), reduces misconfigurations, and meets audit demands (e.g., SOC 2 Type II).
  - **Tools**:

- **Additional Insight**: Integrates with GitOps (e.g., Flux, ArgoCD) for declarative security, a Fortune 100 trend (e.g., Netflix).

#### 4. Threat Modeling
- **Expanded Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Threat Modeling systematically identifies and prioritizes risks (e.g., STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) in app design.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps planning tool (Microsoft STRIDE, OWASP Threat Dragon), done pre-coding to inform architecture (e.g., NIST 800-53 RA-3).
  - **Importance**: Prevents late-stage rework (e.g., 2017 Equifax data flow flaw cost $1B+), ensures proactive defense, and scales to complex systems (e.g., microservices).
  - **Tools**: 
    - STRIDE: Manual methodology with diagrams.
    - Threat Dragon: Open-source modeling tool.

## Practical Implementation Plan
**Objective**: Apply Day 2 topics to secure a microservices app on AWS EKS, simulating a financial services client’s trading platform. Learners will implement a pipeline, secure it, and validate compliance.

- **Duration**: ~2-3 hours (post-learning, can extend beyond Day 2 if needed).
- **Tools**: AWS EKS, Jenkins, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, OPA, Security Hub, AWS Config.
- **Deliverables**: Secure EKS app, pipeline config, compliance report.

### Steps
1. **Setup EKS Cluster** (~30 min):
   - Launch an EKS cluster (`eksctl create cluster --name trading-app --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name workers --nodes 2`).
   - Deploy a simple Node.js microservice (e.g., `/trade` endpoint):
     ```yaml
     # trade-deployment.yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: trade-app
     spec:
       replicas: 2
       template:
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: trade
             image: <ecr-repo>/trade:latest
     ```

2. **Shift-Left Security with SAST** (~20 min):
   - Configure SonarQube in Jenkins:
     ```groovy
     // Jenkinsfile snippet
     stage('SAST') {
       steps {
         sh 'sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=trade-app -Dsonar.sources=.'
       }
     }
     ```
   - Scan `app.js` for vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS), fix findings (e.g., sanitize inputs).

3. **DAST with OWASP ZAP** (~20 min):
   - Deploy the app to staging (`kubectl apply -f trade-deployment.yaml`).
   - Run ZAP: `zap-cli quick-scan --spider -r http://<loadbalancer-url>/trade`.
   - Address alerts (e.g., add Content-Security-Policy header).

4. **Policy as Code with OPA** (~25 min):
   - Create an OPA policy to deny privileged pods:
     ```rego
     # no-privileged.rego
     deny[msg] {
       input.kind == "Pod"
       input.spec.privileged
       msg = "Privileged containers are not allowed"
     }
     ```
   - Apply via Gatekeeper: `kubectl apply -f no-privileged.rego`.
   - Test by deploying a privileged pod (should fail).

5. **Threat Modeling with STRIDE** (~20 min):
   - Model the app:
     - **Spoofing**: Add JWT auth to `/trade`.
     - **DoS**: Set pod resource limits (`cpu: 200m`).
   - Update `trade-deployment.yaml` with mitigations.

6. **Secure CI/CD** (~25 min):
   - Sign Docker images:
     ```bash
     docker trust sign <ecr-repo>/trade:latest
     ```
   - Secure Jenkins with RBAC (e.g., limit `admin` role) and Secrets Manager for ECR creds:
     ```groovy
     stage('Push') {
       withAWS(credentials: 'aws-creds') {
         sh 'docker push <ecr-repo>/trade:latest'
       }
     }
     ```

7. **CSPM with Security Hub** (~15 min):
   - Enable Security Hub, check findings (e.g., “EKS public endpoint”).
   - Remediate: Restrict EKS endpoint to VPC (`eksctl update cluster --name trading-app --public-access=false`).

8. **Compliance Frameworks** (~20 min):
   - Add AWS Config Rule:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_config_rule" "eks_encrypted" {
       name = "eks-endpoint-encrypted"
       source { owner = "AWS" identifier = "EKS_ENDPOINT_ENCRYPTED" }
     }
     ```
   - Validate NIST 800-53 AC-3 (access control) compliance.

9. **Validation** (~15 min):
   - Deploy app, verify functionality (`curl http://<loadbalancer-url>/trade`).
   - Check Security Hub (no critical findings), OPA logs (no violations), pipeline success.

### Deliverables
- **Code**: Updated `Jenkinsfile`, `trade-deployment.yaml`, OPA policy.
- **Report**: Document SAST/DAST findings, STRIDE mitigations, compliance status (e.g., `day2-impl-report.md`).
