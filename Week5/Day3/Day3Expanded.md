## Practical Implementation Plan
**Objective**: Apply Day 3 topics to optimize costs for a multi-tier app (web frontend, API, DB) on AWS, simulating a startup scaling to enterprise. Learners will analyze, adjust, and validate savings.

- **Duration**: ~2-3 hours (post-learning, can extend beyond Day 3 if needed).
- **Tools**: AWS Cost Explorer, EC2, RDS, S3, Budgets, Tags, RIs, Trusted Advisor.
- **Deliverables**: Optimized app, cost report, savings summary.

### Steps
1. **Setup Multi-Tier App** (~30 min):
   - Launch resources in `us-east-1`:
     - EC2 (`t3.large`, Amazon Linux 2) for web frontend.
     - RDS (`db.m5.large`, MySQL) for DB.
     - S3 bucket (`app-logs-<yourname>`) for logs.
   - Deploy a simple Node.js app:
     ```bash
     ssh ec2-user@<ec2-ip> "sudo yum install nodejs -y && echo 'console.log(\"App running\")' > app.js && node app.js &"
     ```

2. **Analyze with Cost Explorer** (~20 min):
   - AWS Console > Cost Explorer > Daily Costs > Last 7 days.
   - Filter by “EC2 - Other” and “RDS” → Note $10/day spend (e.g., $7 EC2, $3 RDS).

3. **Right-Size Resources** (~25 min):
   - Check EC2 CPU: `aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<instance-id> --start-time 2025-03-20T00:00:00Z --end-time 2025-03-26T00:00:00Z --period 3600 --statistics Average` → <20%.
   - Downsize to `t3.medium`: EC2 > Actions > Instance Type > `t3.medium`.
   - Downsize RDS to `db.t3.medium`: RDS > Modify > Apply immediately.

4. **Set S3 Lifecycle Policy** (~15 min):
   - Upload logs to S3: `aws s3 cp log.txt s3://app-logs-<yourname>/`.
   - Add policy:
     ```json
     {
       "Rules": [
         {
           "ID": "GlacierTransition",
           "Status": "Enabled",
           "Prefix": "",
           "Transitions": [{ "Days": 30, "StorageClass": "GLACIER" }],
           "Expiration": { "Days": 90 }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Apply via Console or CLI: `aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket app-logs-<yourname> --lifecycle-configuration file://policy.json`.

5. **Configure Budget Alerts** (~15 min):
   - AWS Budgets > Create Budget > Cost Budget > $5/day > Alert at 80% ($4) > Email: `<your-email>`.
   - Test by running EC2 longer → Verify email alert.

6. **Apply Cost Allocation Tags** (~15 min):
   - Tag resources:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 create-tags --resources <instance-id> --tags Key=Environment,Value=Prod
     aws rds add-tags-to-resource --resource-name <rds-arn> --tags Key=Environment,Value=Prod
     aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket app-logs-<yourname> --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=Environment,Value=Prod}]'
     ```
   - Check Cost Explorer > Group by Tag: `Environment` → Confirm 100% tagged.

7. **Purchase Reserved Instance** (~20 min):
   - EC2 > Reserved Instances > Purchase > `t3.medium`, 1-year, Standard → $200 upfront (mock purchase).
   - Validate savings in Cost Explorer forecast (e.g., $50/month vs. $80 On-Demand).

8. **Run Trusted Advisor** (~15 min):
   - AWS Console > Trusted Advisor > Cost Optimization.
   - Action: Terminate idle EC2 if flagged (e.g., <10% utilization) or delete unattached EBS volumes.

9. **Validate Savings** (~15 min):
   - Re-run Cost Explorer: Daily spend < $5/day (e.g., $3 after optimization).
   - Document: Original ($10/day) vs. New ($3/day) → $7/day saved.

### Deliverables
- **Resources**: Optimized EC2 (`t3.medium`), RDS (`db.t3.medium`), S3 with lifecycle.
- **Report**: `day3-cost-report.md` with Cost Explorer screenshots, tag coverage, savings summary (e.g., “70% reduction”).
