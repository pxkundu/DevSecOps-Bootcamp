### Key Learning Topics

#### 1. AWS Cost Explorer
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that visualizes, analyzes, and forecasts AWS spending, providing insights into cost trends, service usage, and savings opportunities.
  - **Context**: A cornerstone of DevSecOps cost management (introduced 2017), it empowers teams to monitor and optimize spend in real-time, aligning with the AWS Well-Architected Framework’s Cost Optimization Pillar.
  - **Importance**: Enables data-driven decisions (e.g., identifying EC2 as 60% of spend), prevents budget overruns (e.g., 2020 Twilio overspend), and scales to millions of resources.
  - **Features**: Daily/monthly cost breakdowns, service filters (e.g., S3, RDS), forecasting, and custom reports.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Amazon’s Internal Usage**: Amazon uses Cost Explorer to track EC2 spend for AWS services (e.g., Lambda backends), identifying $10M+ in savings annually by spotting underutilized instances across 1M+ customers.
    - **Example**: Filter by “EC2 - Other” → Detect $5K/day spike → Downsize `t3.large` to `t3.medium`.
  - **Walmart’s E-commerce**: Walmart analyzes RDS costs during Black Friday (46M items sold, 2022), cutting $500K by optimizing instance types for 500M+ customers’ data.

#### 2. Resource Right-Sizing
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Resource Right-Sizing adjusts AWS resource configurations (e.g., EC2 instance types, RDS tiers) to match workload needs, avoiding over-provisioning.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps practice rooted in lean IT principles, it balances cost and performance (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Pillar: “Use the right resource type”).
  - **Importance**: Reduces waste (e.g., 40% of cloud spend is unused per Flexera 2023), scales efficiency for millions of users, and supports sustainability goals (e.g., carbon footprint reduction).
  - **Tools**: AWS Compute Optimizer, Cost Explorer usage reports, manual CLI analysis.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Netflix’s EC2 Optimization**: Netflix right-sizes EC2 instances for encoding workloads (e.g., `c5.4xlarge` to `c5.2xlarge`), saving $1M+ monthly for 247M subscribers’ 17B+ streaming hours.
    - **Example**: CLI check: `aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"` → CPU < 20% → Downsize.
  - **Amazon’s Lambda Tuning**: Amazon adjusts Lambda memory (e.g., 1024MB to 512MB) for low-intensity functions, cutting costs by 30% for 1B+ daily executions.

#### 3. S3 Lifecycle Policies
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: S3 Lifecycle Policies automate transitions of objects between storage classes (e.g., Standard to Glacier) or expiration, optimizing storage costs based on access patterns.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps cost-saving tactic (S3 feature since 2010), it aligns with long-term data management (e.g., NIST 800-53 MP-6 Media Sanitization for expiration).
  - **Importance**: Cuts costs by 50-90% for archival data (e.g., $0.023/GB Standard vs. $0.004/GB Glacier), scales to petabytes, and meets compliance (e.g., GDPR data retention).
  - **Classes**: Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, Deep Archive.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Netflix’s Video Archives**: Netflix transitions old video logs to Glacier after 30 days, saving $2M+ yearly for petabytes of data supporting 15% of global internet traffic.
    - **Example**: Policy: `Transition to Glacier after 30 days` → `$0.023/GB to $0.004/GB`.
  - **Walmart’s Supply Chain Logs**: Walmart expires 90-day-old S3 logs for 150M weekly shoppers, reducing costs by 70% while retaining audit trails for compliance.

#### 4. Budget Alerts
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Budget Alerts in AWS Budgets notify teams when costs approach or exceed predefined thresholds, enabling proactive cost control.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps governance tool (AWS Budgets launched 2016), it enforces financial discipline (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Pillar: “Plan and track costs”).
  - **Importance**: Prevents surprises (e.g., $50K bill from a forgotten resource), scales to 1000s of accounts, and supports team accountability (e.g., dev vs. prod spend).
  - **Features**: Custom budgets, email/SNS alerts, cost/usage tracking.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Amazon’s Team Budgets**: Amazon sets $10K/month budgets per AWS team, alerting at 80% ($8K) via SNS, saving $5M+ yearly by catching overspend early for 1M+ customers.
    - **Example**: Budget: `$10K` → Alert: `$8K reached` → Stop idle EC2.
  - **Walmart’s Peak Planning**: Walmart uses alerts during holiday sales (e.g., 20K transactions/min), capping RDS spend at $20K, adjusting resources for 240M weekly customers.

#### 5. Cost Allocation Tags
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Cost Allocation Tags are metadata (e.g., `Environment=Prod`) applied to AWS resources for granular cost tracking and reporting in Cost Explorer.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps best practice (AWS tagging since 2010), it enables cost attribution (e.g., AWS Well-Architected: “Understand cost drivers”).
  - **Importance**: Breaks down spend by team/project (e.g., 60% prod, 40% dev), scales to millions of resources, and aids budgeting (e.g., chargeback models).
  - **Tools**: AWS Tag Editor, Cost Explorer tag filters, CLI tagging.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Amazon’s Multi-Team Tracking**: Amazon tags EC2/RDS with `Team=Search`, revealing $15M+ annual spend, optimizing 1M+ customer searches daily.
    - **Example**: `aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-123 --tags Key=Team,Value=Search`.
  - **Netflix’s Content Tagging**: Netflix tags S3 buckets with `Project=Encoding`, cutting $500K by identifying unused dev data for 247M users.

#### 6. Reserved Instances (RIs)
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: Reserved Instances (RIs) are pre-purchased AWS capacity commitments (1-3 years) for predictable workloads, offering up to 75% savings over On-Demand pricing.
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps cost strategy (RIs since 2009), it locks in discounts for stable usage (e.g., AWS Well-Architected: “Commit to capacity”).
  - **Importance**: Saves millions for steady-state apps (e.g., $0.10/hr On-Demand vs. $0.03/hr RI), scales to 1000s of instances, and balances cost/performance.
  - **Types**: Standard RIs, Convertible RIs, Savings Plans.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Amazon’s EC2 RIs**: Amazon reserves EC2 for AWS control plane (e.g., `m5.large`), saving $20M+ yearly for 1M+ customers’ infrastructure.
    - **Example**: Purchase 3-year Standard RI → $10K upfront → $5K/year savings.
  - **Walmart’s POS Systems**: Walmart uses RIs for RDS in 11,000+ stores, cutting $1M+ annually for 500M+ customer transactions.

#### 7. AWS Trusted Advisor
- **Theoretical Keyword Explanation**:
  - **Definition**: AWS Trusted Advisor provides real-time recommendations for cost optimization, security, and performance (e.g., idle resources, underutilized EBS).
  - **Context**: A DevSecOps automation tool (launched 2013), it aligns with AWS Well-Architected’s five pillars, focusing on cost checks.
  - **Importance**: Identifies savings (e.g., 20% of EC2 idle per AWS), scales to enterprise accounts, and supports proactive optimization (e.g., $100K+ savings).
  - **Checks**: Idle EC2, unassociated EIPs, low-utilization RDS.
- **Practical Use Cases**:
  - **Netflix’s Idle Cleanup**: Trusted Advisor flags idle EC2 instances post-encoding, saving $300K+ yearly for 247M subscribers’ content delivery.
    - **Example**: “10 Idle EC2 Instances” → Terminate → $1K/month saved.
  - **Amazon’s EBS Optimization**: Amazon uses Trusted Advisor to delete unattached EBS volumes, cutting $500K+ for 1M+ customers’ storage.
