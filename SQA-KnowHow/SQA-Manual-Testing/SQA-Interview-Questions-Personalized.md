### 5. Give an example of how you evaluated and improved a software quality method.
- **STAR Answer**:
  - **Situation**: During Calysta Pro EMR development, our manual testing process was slow and missed edge cases.
  - **Task**: I was responsible for evaluating and enhancing our QA approach.
  - **Action**: I introduced exploratory testing alongside scripted tests, using my frontend knowledge to probe React.js UI limits (e.g., invalid inputs). I tracked improvements via Jira defect trends and proposed adding Cypress for repetitive checks.
  - **Result**: Defect detection rose by 30%, testing efficiency improved, and the EMR system met ISO 13485 standards with fewer post-launch issues.

### 6. How did you define and monitor software quality metrics for a medical platform?
- **STAR Answer**:
  - **Situation**: On Janssen Medical Cloud, we needed clear quality metrics to ensure reliability.
  - **Task**: I was tasked with defining and tracking these metrics for stakeholder updates.
  - **Action**: I set metrics like 95% test coverage, <5 critical defects, and UI load time <2 seconds. I monitored them using TestRail dashboards and ran manual performance tests with JMeter, reporting risks in sprint reviews.
  - **Result**: We hit 97% coverage, resolved all critical bugs pre-release, and stakeholders greenlit deployment, praising my data-driven insights.

### 7. Describe a time you created a project-specific quality strategy for a digital healthcare product.
- **STAR Answer**:
  - **Situation**: For Janssen With Me, we needed a tailored QA plan for a patient engagement app.
  - **Task**: My role was to design and operationalize a strategy meeting ISO 14971 risk standards.
  - **Action**: I crafted a plan focusing on manual usability testing with mock patients, security testing for GDPR compliance, and boundary tests for data inputs. I used Jira to assign tasks and track execution.
  - **Result**: The app launched with zero high-risk defects, met regulatory requirements, and my strategy was adopted for future J&J projects.

### 8. How have you ensured compliance with medical software regulations like IEC 62304?
- **STAR Answer**:
  - **Situation**: At SJ Innovation, I worked on Calysta Pro EMR, which required IEC 62304 and ISO 13485 adherence.
  - **Task**: I had to ensure our QA process supported compliance for this EMR system.
  - **Action**: I aligned manual test cases with lifecycle requirements (e.g., data validation), documented results in TestRail for audits, and conducted risk-based testing on critical features like prescription logging.
  - **Result**: The system passed a third-party audit with no major non-conformities, and my compliance work streamlined J&J’s validation process.
