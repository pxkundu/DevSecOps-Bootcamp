Let’s kick off **Week 2, Day 1** of our AWS DevOps Bootcamp! 

As promised, Week 2 will elevate us from beginner to **intermediate-to-advanced** levels, focusing on unique, out-of-the-box learning approaches and tackling more complex AWS topics. **AWS keywords** rooted in AWS documentation and cloud principles (e.g., [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/), [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials/)), ensuring deeper theoretical coverage and practical implementation for each day.

Below, I’ll first provide an **overview plan for Week 2**, day by day, tailored to your request for originality, technical depth, and an engaging experience. 

This builds on Week 1’s foundation (EC2, VPC, scripting) and aligns with AWS documentation, like the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/), while pushing boundaries with creative twists.

### Week 2 Overview Plan: Intermediate-to-Advanced AWS Cloud Learning

#### Approach
- **Out-of-the-Box Twist**: Unique daily challenges (escape room, heist, siege, sabotage, showdown) simulate real-world DevOps scenarios with chaos and competition.
- **Technical Complexity**: Intermediate-to-advanced—spanning managed services, IaC, serverless, containers, and orchestration, with production-grade practices.
- **Learning Goal**: Master AWS cloud theory (e.g., scalability, security) and implement multi-tier, resilient systems.

#### Day-Wise Plan with AWS Keywords

##### Day 1: CI/CD Fundamentals - "Pipeline Escape Room"
- **Focus**: Build and debug automated CI/CD pipelines.
- **Theory**: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Source Control, Build Automation, Deployment Stages.
- **Practical**: Deploy a static site to **Amazon S3** using **AWS CodePipeline**, **AWS CodeBuild**, and **AWS CodeCommit**.
- **AWS Keywords**: Amazon S3, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeCommit, AWS IAM, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS KMS, AWS CloudFormation, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Shared Responsibility Model.
- **Twist**: Escape a broken pipeline by fixing IAM, logs, and build errors under time pressure.
- **Why More Keywords**: Adds security (IAM, KMS), monitoring (CloudWatch), and IaC (CloudFormation) for depth.
Got it! I’ll ensure the remaining days of **Week 2** match the extensive depth of the revised **Week 2, Day 1**, packing in rich **AWS theory**, **DevOps theoretical knowledge**, and detailed **practical implementation** with a focus on intermediate-to-advanced complexity. Each day will include comprehensive sub-activities, AWS keywords from official documentation (e.g., [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/), [AWS DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/)), and out-of-the-box twists to keep the learning engaging. Below is the updated **Week 2 Overview Plan** with extensive detail for **Days 2-5**, building on Day 1’s structure.
