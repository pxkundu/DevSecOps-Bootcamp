# Week 2, Day 5: Kubernetes on AWS EKS Capstone - "Production Siege"

## Overview
This README serves as a wrap-up index for **Week 2, Day 5** of our DevOps learning journey, focusing on deploying a **production-grade microservices application** on **Amazon EKS**. The capstone integrates CI/CD (Day 1), serverless (Day 2), containers (Day 3), and Kubernetes basics (Day 4) into a real-world scenario, simulating a "Production Siege" (e.g., traffic spikes, node failures). Itâ€™s tailored for DevOps engineers aiming to master Kubernetes orchestration on AWS, with practical use cases inspired by companies like Netflix, Spotify, and Airbnb.

- **Duration**: 6-7 hours
- **Objective**: Deploy a scalable, resilient app (React frontend, Node.js API, Redis cache) on EKS, automate with AWS CodePipeline, and survive production challenges.
- **Tools**: AWS CLI, `eksctl`, `kubectl`, Helm, Docker, Git, AWS CodePipeline.

## Content Index

### 1. Theory: EKS, Kubernetes in Production, and DevOps Best Practices (1.5 hours)
- **Focus**: Theoretical foundation for running Kubernetes on EKS in production.
- **Key Topics**:
  - **Amazon EKS**: Managed Kubernetes control plane for high availability (HA).
  - **Cluster Architecture**: Control plane + worker nodes (EC2/Fargate).
  - **Core Constructs**: Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), PersistentVolumes (PV).
  - **AWS Integrations**: AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB), Amazon EBS CSI Driver, Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights, AWS CodePipeline.
  - **DevOps Practices**: Automation, Collaboration, Continuous Deployment, Observability, Shift Left, Resilience, Cost Optimization, Security.
- **Keywords**: Amazon EKS, Kubernetes, Cluster, Pod, Deployment, Service, Ingress, HPA, PV, AWS Load Balancer Controller, EBS CSI Driver, CloudWatch Container Insights, CodePipeline, Automation, Resilience, Security, Shared Responsibility Model, Microservices, Production Readiness.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Netflixâ€™s global streaming APIs, Spotifyâ€™s playlist scaling, Airbnbâ€™s booking persistence.

### 2. Lab: Deploy a Production-Grade App on EKS with CI/CD (3-3.5 hours)
- **Goal**: Deploy a microservices app on EKS, automate with CI/CD, and prepare for production.
- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: React app serving a streaming UI.
  - **API**: Node.js app with Redis caching for status checks.
  - **Redis**: Persistent cache for stateful data.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Setup**: Installed AWS CLI, `eksctl`, `kubectl`, Helm, Docker; initialized Git repo.
  2. **Containers**: Built and pushed React frontend and Node.js API to Amazon ECR.
  3. **EKS Cluster**: Created a production-ready cluster with `eksctl` (t3.large nodes, 3-6 scale).
  4. **Add-ons**: Installed AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB), EBS CSI Driver, CloudWatch Container Insights.
  5. **Deployment**: Applied Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, PVC) for app components.
  6. **CI/CD**: Configured AWS CodePipeline to deploy from GitHub to EKS.
- **Structure**:
```
  eks-capstone/
  â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                # React frontend
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # Node.js API
  â”œâ”€â”€ k8s/                    # Kubernetes manifests
  â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline/               # CI/CD configs
  â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
 ```
- **Commands**: See detailed steps in the [full Day 5 guide](#).

### 3. Chaos Twist: "Production Siege" (1-1.5 hours)
- **Goal**: Defend against simulated production challenges (e.g., traffic spikes, node failures).
- **Scenario**: High load (`ab -n 10000 -c 100`), node termination.
- **Tasks**:
  - Monitored with `kubectl get pods` and CloudWatch metrics.
  - Scaled pods (`kubectl scale`) and nodes (`eksctl scale nodegroup`).
  - Added HPA for dynamic scaling (`kubectl autoscale`).
- **Outcome**: App remained available, showcasing resilience.

### 4. Wrap-Up: War Room Debrief (45 min)
- **Goal**: Reflect on production readiness and DevOps lessons.
- **Activities**:
  - Demoed app at `http://<alb-dns>` and `/api/status`.
  - Reviewed siege fixes (scaling, recovery).
  - Analyzed CI/CD pipeline logs.
- **Takeaways**: Production-grade EKS deployment, real-world resilience strategies.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Theoretical Mastery**:
  - Understood EKS architecture and Kubernetes production constructs.
  - Learned DevOps best practices for automation, resilience, and observability.
- **Practical Skills**:
  - Deployed a microservices app on EKS with ALB, EBS, and CloudWatch.
  - Automated deployments with CodePipeline.
  - Managed a production siege with scaling and recovery.

## Real-World DevOps Use Cases
1. **Netflix Streaming Platform**:
   - EKS cluster with frontend, API, and Redis.
   - Scales pods for millions of viewers (e.g., new season drop).
   - CI/CD deploys updates continuously.
2. **Spotify Playlist Service**:
   - API caches playlists in Redis, served via ALB.
   - HPA adjusts pod count during peak usage.
   - CloudWatch tracks latency and errors.
3. **Airbnb Booking System**:
   - Stateful Redis persists booking data with EBS.
   - EKS ensures HA across AZs.
   - Pipeline automates feature rollouts.

---

## Best Practices Applied
- **Automation**: CodePipeline for CI/CD.
- **Resilience**: Self-healing pods, HPA, multi-AZ nodes.
- **Observability**: CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics/logs.
- **Security**: IAM roles, RBAC (implicit via add-ons).
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized t3.large nodes, scalable design.

---

## Tips and Tricks
- **Quick Cluster Check**: `kubectl get nodes` and `eksctl get cluster`.
- **Debugging**: `kubectl describe pod <name>` for events, `kubectl logs` for issues.
- **Scaling**: Test HPA with `kubectl autoscale` before prod.
- **Pipeline**: Use `--dry-run` in `buildspec.yml` for testing.

## Resources
- **Docs**: [EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/), [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/), [AWS Well-Architected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/).
- **Repo**: Clone this project for manifests and pipeline configs.
- **Next Steps**: Explore AWS X-Ray for tracing, Spot Instances for cost savings.

## Cleanup (Optional)
To avoid costs:
```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name StreamingCluster
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name EKSPipeline
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name streaming-frontend --force
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name streaming-api --force
```
