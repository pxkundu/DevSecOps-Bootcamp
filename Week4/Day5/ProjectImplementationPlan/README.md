Let’s create a highly productive implementation plan for the **CRM-Integrated Global Supply Chain System** capstone project, structured into five distinct phases to ensure clarity, efficiency, and success. 

These phases—**Design, Backend, Frontend, Core Features, and Delivery**—focus on designing a cost-optimized solutions architecture, developing backend and frontend components, defining core features, embedding DevSecOps best practices, and ensuring automated testing for a production-grade outcome. 

This plan optimizes for budget, leverages existing Day 2 CRM work, and aligns with Fortune 100 standards (e.g., Walmart, Amazon, DHL), balancing cost, scalability, and security.

## Implementation Plan: CRM-Integrated Global Supply Chain System

### Overview
- **Goal**: Deliver a multi-region, cost-efficient system integrating CRM and supply chain operations.
- **Scope**: Reuse Day 2’s Terraform/EKS setup, extend with supply chain microservices, and automate via Jenkins.
- **Budget Focus**: Minimize AWS costs (e.g., use t3 instances, optimize replicas), streamline development.

### Time Allocation
- Total: 3 hours (Day 5 capstone)
- Each phase: ~35-40 minutes

### Phases

#### Phase 1: Design - Solutions Architecture for Infrastructure
- **Objective**: Define a cost-optimized, multi-region architecture.
- **Tasks**:
  - Reuse Day 2’s Terraform setup: EKS in `us-east-1` (primary), `eu-west-1` (secondary).
  - Extend VPC modules for subnets, NAT Gateways (minimal, e.g., 1 NAT per region).
  - Plan RDS (PostgreSQL t3.micro, multi-AZ off for cost) in `us-east-1`.
  - Use S3 (standard-infrequent access tier) for state/logs, DynamoDB (on-demand) for locking.
  - Optimize: t3.medium EKS nodes (2 per region), ECR with lifecycle policies (retain latest 5 images).
- **Deliverable**: Updated `main.tf` with cost-efficient infra design.
- **Budget**: ~$50/month (EKS: $0.10/hr x 2 regions, RDS: $0.017/hr, S3/DynamoDB minimal).

#### Phase 2: Backend - Microservices Development
- **Objective**: Build backend services for CRM and supply chain.
- **Tasks**:
  - Reuse CRM: `crm-api` (customer orders).
  - Add Supply Chain:
    - `inventory-service`: REST API, PostgreSQL for stock (Dockerized, Node.js).
    - `logistics-service`: Stateless, shipping logic (Dockerized, Node.js).
    - `order-service`: Links CRM orders to supply chain (Dockerized, Node.js).
  - Optimize: Lightweight Node.js (Alpine base), minimal dependencies.
- **Deliverable**: Docker images for 4 backend services in local registry.
- **Budget**: Development cost only (no additional AWS spend yet).

#### Phase 3: Frontend - User Interfaces
- **Objective**: Develop UIs for CRM and supply chain interaction.
- **Tasks**:
  - Reuse CRM: `crm-ui` (Node.js, Express, customer dashboard).
  - Add Supply Chain:
    - `tracking-ui`: Displays shipment status (Node.js, Express, fetches from `logistics-service`).
  - Optimize: Single-page apps, minimal JS (no heavy frameworks like React for cost/time).
- **Deliverable**: Docker images for 2 frontend services.
- **Budget**: Local development, no extra infra cost.

#### Phase 4: Core Features - Integration and Functionality
- **Objective**: Enlist and implement key features with Kubernetes.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Features**:
    - CRM: Order placement (`crm-ui` → `crm-api` → `order-service`).
    - Supply Chain: Inventory check (`inventory-service`), shipment tracking (`tracking-ui` → `logistics-service`).
    - Analytics: Reuse `crm-analytics` for sales, add basic supply chain dashboard.
    - API Gateway: NGINX Ingress routes `supplychain-crm.globalretail.com`.
  - Kubernetes:
    - Namespaces: `crm-us`, `crm-eu`, `supply-us`, `supply-eu`.
    - Deployments: 2 replicas each (cost-optimized), Services (LoadBalancer for UIs, ClusterIP for APIs).
    - HPA: `analytics-service` (CPU > 70%, max 4 replicas).
    - Multi-region failover: `us-east-1` primary, `eu-west-1` on standby.
  - **Deliverable**: K8s manifests (`crm-deployment.yaml`, `supply-deployment.yaml`).
- **Budget**: EKS compute (~$0.08/hr/node x 4 nodes), Ingress minimal.

#### Phase 5: Delivery - DevSecOps and Testing Automation
- **Objective**: Ensure secure, automated delivery and validation.
- **Tasks**:
  - **DevSecOps Best Practices**:
    - Security: IAM roles (least privilege), K8s RBAC (namespace-scoped), RDS encryption.
    - Compliance: S3 versioning for state audit, Jenkins pipeline logs.
    - Observability: Basic logging in services (prep for Prometheus).
    - Modularity: Reuse Day 2 Terraform modules.
    - Resilience: Rolling updates for zero-downtime.
  - **Jenkins Pipeline**:
    - Update `Jenkinsfile`: Build 6 Docker images, push to ECR, apply Terraform/K8s.
    - GitOps: Trigger on `main` commits.
  - **Testing Automation**:
    - Script: Test CRM order → inventory sync → tracking UI.
    - Command: `kubectl get pods` + curl `<LoadBalancerURL>` for validation.
  - **Deliverable**: Running system, automated pipeline, test script.
- **Budget**: Jenkins on existing Day 2 EC2 (no extra cost), ECR storage (~$0.10/GB).

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Infra**: Use t3 instances (spot if possible), limit replicas (2 vs. 3), single-AZ RDS.
- **Storage**: S3 IA tier, ECR lifecycle to prune old images.
- **Compute**: HPA caps at 4 replicas, standby `eu-west-1` only activates on failure.
- **Development**: Local Docker builds, reuse Day 2 setup to avoid rework.

### Total Estimated Budget
- **AWS**: ~$60-70/month (EKS, RDS, S3, ECR).
- **Development**: 3 hours (Day 5), no additional tooling costs.

### Success Criteria
- System runs at `supplychain-crm.globalretail.com`.
- Pipeline deploys updates without downtime.
- Multi-region failover works (disable `us-east-1`, verify `eu-west-1`).
- Automated tests pass (order placement, tracking).

This 5-phase plan ensures a structured, cost-efficient, and DevSecOps-aligned delivery, merging CRM and supply chain seamlessly. Each phase builds on the last, leveraging existing work for productivity and budget control.
