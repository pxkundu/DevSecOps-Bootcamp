Let’s define the **Deliverable for Phase 1: Design - Solutions Architecture for Infrastructure**. 

Phase 1 focuses on setting up the Terraform infrastructure blueprint, so the deliverables will be the Terraform configuration files in the `infrastructure/` directory, reflecting the multi-region EKS, VPCs, RDS, S3, and ECR design.

## Deliverable for Phase 1
The deliverable for Phase 1 is a fully configured Terraform setup in the `CRMSupplyChainCapstone/infrastructure/` directory, enabling provisioning of the multi-region infrastructure. This includes:
- **`main.tf`**: Root configuration calling VPC, EKS, and RDS modules for `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1`.
- **`variables.tf`**: Input variables for regions, instance types, and other parameters.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Outputs for EKS endpoints and RDS connection string.
- **`backend.tf`**: Remote state configuration reusing Day 2’s S3/DynamoDB setup.
- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Placeholder for variable overrides (gitignored).
- **`modules/vpc/`**: Reusable VPC module with public/private subnets and 1 NAT Gateway.
- **`modules/eks/`**: Reusable EKS module with t3.medium nodes and IAM roles.
- **`modules/rds/`**: RDS module for PostgreSQL t3.micro in `us-east-1`.

These files form the infrastructure blueprint, optimized for cost (~$60-70/month), scalability, and DevSecOps practices (encryption, IAM, modularity).

## Notes on Deliverables
- **Clean & Optimized**: 
  - Files are concise, with defaults (e.g., `t3.medium`, 2 nodes) for cost efficiency.
  - ECR lifecycle isn’t scripted (manual AWS config), but repos are defined.
- **Original Structure**: 
  - Only `infrastructure/` is populated with content; other dirs remain as placeholders.
  - Matches the provided structure exactly.
- **DevSecOps**:
  - IAM roles use least privilege.
  - RDS password is a placeholder (use AWS Secrets Manager in production).
  - Security groups restrict access (e.g., RDS to VPC CIDR).

These deliverables provide a functional Terraform setup to provision the Phase 1 infrastructure, ready for `terraform init` and `apply` (after AWS credentials setup).
