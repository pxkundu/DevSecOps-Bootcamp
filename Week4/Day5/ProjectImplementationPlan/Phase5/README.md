## Phase 5: Delivery - DevSecOps and Testing Automation

### Objective
- Deliver a fully automated, secure, and validated system deployment using Jenkins for CI/CD, Terraform for infrastructure, and automated tests for feature verification.
- Establish a reference-grade DevSecOps pipeline that ensures resilience, compliance, and observability.

### Real-World Time Estimate
- **DevSecOps Setup**: ~3-4 days (Terraform, IAM, RBAC, Jenkins).
- **Pipeline Development**: ~2-3 days (Jenkinsfile, GitOps integration).
- **Testing Automation**: ~2 days (scripts, validation).
- **Total**: ~7-9 days for 2-3 engineers, a realistic sprint to finalize production readiness.

---

### Thought Process
- **End-to-End Automation**: Automate the build, push, and deployment of all services (6 Docker images from Phases 2-3) to ECR and EKS, ensuring zero manual intervention—a hallmark of modern DevOps (e.g., Amazon’s pipelines).
- **Security as Priority**: Embed least privilege IAM roles, Kubernetes RBAC, and RDS encryption to meet retail compliance (e.g., PCI DSS-like standards).
- **Resilience**: Use rolling updates and multi-region failover (from Phase 4) for zero-downtime deployments, critical for customer-facing systems (e.g., Walmart’s uptime).
- **Observability**: Add basic logging with future Prometheus hooks, balancing immediate needs with scalability (e.g., DHL’s monitoring).
- **Testing**: Validate the core feature flow (order → inventory → tracking) with automated scripts, ensuring functionality post-deployment—a QA standard.
- **Legacy Focus**: Design a modular, reusable pipeline and IaC that others can adapt, making this a capstone benchmark.

## Solutions Design

### 1. DevSecOps Best Practices
#### Security
- **IAM Roles**:
  - **Design**: Create an IAM role (`eks-deployment-role`) with least privilege (e.g., `ecr:PutImage`, `eks:DescribeCluster`) for Jenkins to interact with ECR and EKS.
  - **Why**: Reduces attack surface, a retail security must (e.g., Amazon’s IAM policies).
- **Kubernetes RBAC**:
  - **Design**: Namespace-scoped `Role` and `RoleBinding` for each service (e.g., `crm-us-role` allows `crm-ui` pod access only to its secrets).
  - **Why**: Enforces isolation, aligning with Kubernetes security best practices.
- **RDS Encryption**:
  - **Design**: Enable encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS) in `infrastructure/modules/rds/`.
  - **Why**: Protects sensitive order data, meeting compliance (e.g., GDPR).

#### Compliance
- **S3 Versioning**:
  - **Design**: Configure `backend.tf` to use an S3 bucket with versioning for Terraform state.
  - **Why**: Audits infrastructure changes, a retail compliance requirement.
- **Jenkins Logs**:
  - **Design**: Persist pipeline logs to S3 via Jenkins config.
  - **Why**: Ensures traceability, a DevSecOps audit standard.

#### Observability
- **Basic Logging**:
  - **Design**: Update `app.js` in all services to log key events (e.g., `console.log("Order created")`) to stdout, captured by EKS/CloudWatch.
  - **Why**: Immediate visibility with minimal overhead, prepping for Prometheus (e.g., Walmart’s logging).
- **Future Prometheus**:
  - **Design**: Add `/metrics` endpoint placeholders in `analytics-service` for Phase 5+ enhancements.
  - **Why**: Scalable observability roadmap.

#### Modularity
- **Terraform Modules**:
  - **Design**: Reuse `infrastructure/modules/{vpc,eks,rds}` from Day 2, adding variables for multi-region (`us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).
  - **Why**: Reusability reduces future effort, a DevOps principle.

#### Resilience
- **Rolling Updates**:
  - **Design**: Set `strategy: rollingUpdate` in Phase 4 deployments (e.g., `crm-ui-deployment.yaml`).
  - **Why**: Ensures zero-downtime, critical for retail UIs (e.g., DHL’s updates).

### 2. Jenkins Pipeline
- **What**: Automate build, push, and deployment of 6 services (`crm-api`, `crm-ui`, `order-service`, `inventory-service`, `logistics-service`, `tracking-ui`).
- **How**:
  - **Design**:
    - **Stages**: Checkout, Build (6 Docker images), Push (to ECR), Terraform Apply (EKS, RDS), K8s Apply (manifests).
    - **GitOps**: Trigger on `main` branch commits via webhook.
    - **File**: Update `pipeline/Jenkinsfile`.
  - **Why**: Streamlines delivery, a retail CI/CD norm (e.g., Amazon’s CodePipeline).
- **Diagram**:
  ```
  +-----+    Commit      +--------------------+    Build/Push   +-----+    Apply    +-----+
  | Git | -------------> | Jenkins            | --------------> | ECR | ----------> | EKS |
  +-----+                | Pipeline           |                 +-----+             +-----+
                         +--------------------+
                         | Stages:            |
                         | - Checkout         |
                         | - Build 6 Images   |
                         | - Push to ECR      |
                         | - Terraform Apply  |
                         | - K8s Apply        |
                         +--------------------+
  ```

### 3. Testing Automation
- **What**: Validate CRM order → inventory sync → tracking UI flow.
- **How**:
  - **Design**:
    - Script: `tests/integration/test-full-flow.sh` uses `curl` to place an order, check inventory, and verify tracking UI.
    - Command: `kubectl get pods` + `curl <LoadBalancerURL>` for health checks.
  - **Why**: Ensures feature integrity post-deployment, a QA benchmark.
- **Diagram**:
  ```
  +----------------+    Order   +---------+    Sync    +-----------------+
  | test-full-flow | ---------> | crm-ui  | ---------> | order-service   |
  +----------------+            +---------+            +-----------------+
                                       | Sync           +-------------------+
                                       +--------------> | inventory-service |
                                       | Tracking       +-------------------+
                                       +--------------> | tracking-ui       |
                                                        +-------------------+
  ```

- **Security**: Encrypted RDS and least privilege match PCI DSS-like requirements.
- **Testing**: Automated end-to-end tests reflect enterprise QA (e.g., DHL’s validation).

### DevSecOps Best Practices
1. **Security**:
   - IAM roles, RBAC, and encryption at rest/in transit.
2. **Resilience**:
   - Rolling updates and failover for zero-downtime.
3. **Observability**:
   - Logging to CloudWatch, Prometheus-ready endpoints.
4. **Automation**:
   - Jenkins pipeline and Terraform IaC for full automation.
5. **Cost Management**:
   - Jenkins on existing EC2 (no extra cost), ECR at ~$0.10/GB.

  - `infrastructure/{main.tf,variables.tf,outputs.tf,backend.tf}`: Terraform for EKS, RDS.
  - `pipeline/Jenkinsfile`: Updated pipeline.
  - `tests/integration/test-full-flow.sh`: Test script.
  - Running system on EKS.
- **Budget**: Jenkins on existing EC2, ECR storage (~$0.10/GB), EKS (~$0.32/hr from Phase 4).
- **Legacy**: Documented in `docs/README.md` as a reference guide.
